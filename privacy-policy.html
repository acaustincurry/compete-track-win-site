        <p>We access Apple HealthKit data only with your explicit authorization. HealthKit data is used exclusively for scoring challenges within the app. We do not sell, share, or use HealthKit data for advertising or marketing purposes.

        <h2>4. Payment Processing</h2>
        <p>All financial transactions are processed through Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor. We use Stripe Connect to facilitate payouts to challenge winners. We do not have direct access to your full payment card details.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. Challenge history and scores are retained for record-keeping purposes. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us.</p>
