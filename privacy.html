        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

        <p>Compete. Track. Win. ("CTW," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and profile photo (if provided). Authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In and Apple Sign-In).</p>
        <p><strong>Health and Fitness Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, we access workout data from Apple HealthKit, including workout type, duration, distance, calories burned, and heart rate. We only read workout data — we never write to your HealthKit store.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Payment processing is handled entirely by Stripe. We do not store your credit card numbers, bank account details, or other sensitive financial information on our servers. Stripe may collect information as described in their <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the app, including challenges created or joined, messages sent in challenge chats, and leaderboard activity.</p>
        <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect device identifiers and push notification tokens to deliver notifications about challenge updates.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the app</li>
            <li>Process challenge buy-ins and distribute payouts</li>
            <li>Track and display workout activity on challenge leaderboards</li>
            <li>Send push notifications about challenge updates</li>
            <li>Enable in-app messaging between challenge participants</li>
            <li>Prevent fraud and enforce our Terms of Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. HealthKit Data</h2>
        <p>We take the privacy of your health data seriously. In accordance with Apple's requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HealthKit data is used solely to track your workout activity within challenges you have joined</li>
            <li>We do not sell HealthKit data to third parties</li>
            <li>We do not use HealthKit data for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
            <li>HealthKit data is not shared with third parties except as aggregated, non-identifying scores displayed on challenge leaderboards to other participants of that challenge</li>
            <li>You can revoke HealthKit access at any time through your device's Settings app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> To process payments and payouts</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For authentication, data storage, and cloud functions</li>
            <li><strong>Other Challenge Participants:</strong> Your display name, profile photo, and workout scores are visible to other participants in challenges you join</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, court order, or governmental authority</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely using Firebase (Google Cloud). We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your account information for as long as your account is active. Challenge data (including leaderboard results and chat messages) is retained for the duration of the challenge and a reasonable period thereafter. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your account and data</li>
            <li>Revoke HealthKit permissions at any time</li>
            <li>Opt out of push notifications through your device settings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The app is not intended for children under 17 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 17. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last updated" date above.</p>
