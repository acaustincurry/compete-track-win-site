            <h3>How are workouts tracked?</h3>

            <h3>How do payouts work?</h3>
            <p>When a challenge ends, winnings are automatically transferred to your connected bank account via Stripe. Set up your payout account in your Profile before a challenge ends to receive winnings promptly.</p>

            <h3>What if I didn't set up my payout account in time?</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
            <p>If a challenge is cancelled before it starts, all buy-ins are automatically refunded. If you are removed from a challenge by the captain, your buy-in is refunded. For other refund requests, please contact us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do handicaps work?</h3>
            <p>In challenges with Captain Handicaps, the captain assigns a multiplier (0.25x to 1.5x) to each participant. Your raw workout points are multiplied by your handicap to calculate your adjusted score. A lower handicap means you earn fewer points per workout, leveling the playing field.</p>
